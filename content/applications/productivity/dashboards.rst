Dashboards
==========

The **Dashboards** application displays data collated from spreadsheets in a read-only format. It
also allows users to create a custom dashboard that displays data from various applications. These
dashboards can be customized for individual users based on visibility settings, and the apps that
are installed.

.. note::
   The main **Spreadsheet dashboard** app, is automatically installed with most databases. To allow
   users to customize their own dashboards, the **Dashboards** app must be :ref:`installed
   <general/install>`.
