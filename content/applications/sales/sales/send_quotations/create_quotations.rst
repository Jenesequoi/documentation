Create quotations
=================

In Odoo **Sales**, quotations can be created and sent to customers. Once a quotation has been
confirmed, it officially turns into a *sales order*, which can then be invoiced and paid for.

Quotations dashboard
====================

The *Quotations* dashboard is the page that appears when the :menuselection:`Sales app` is opened.

By default, the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard displays all quotations in the database related to
the current user, as indicated by the default :guilabel:`My Quotations` filter present in the search
bar.

.. image:: create_quotations/quotations-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Quotations dashboard present in the Odoo Sales application.

.. note::
   To view *all* quotations in the database, remove the :guilabel:`My Quotations` filter from the
   search bar.

Quotations on this page appear in a default list view, but can also be viewed in a
:icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`Kanban` view, :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`Calendar`,
:icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`Pivot` table, :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`Graph`, or
:icon:`fa-clock-o` :guilabel:`Activity` view.

To view and/or modify any listed quotation from the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard, click on the
desired quotation, and Odoo reveals the specific form for that selected quotation.

Create quotation
================

To create a quotation, open the :menuselection:`Sales app`, and click the :guilabel:`New` button,
located in the upper-left corner of the main :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`New` button is **only** present if the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard is in list
   or Kanban view.

Clicking the :guilabel:`New` button reveals a blank quotation form, with various fields and tabs to
configure.

.. tip::
   To create a new quotation from the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard, while in :icon:`fa-calendar`
   :guilabel:`Calendar` view, click into the desired date/time slot on the calendar, and Odoo
   presents a new quotation form.

.. image:: create_quotations/quotation-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A typical quotation form in the Odoo Sales application.

On the quotation form, begin by entering the customer's name in the :guilabel:`Customer` field at
the top of the form. This is a **required** field.

If the customer's information is already in the database, the :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and
:guilabel:`Delivery Address` fields auto-populate with the saved information for those respective
fields, based on the data from that customer's contact record (found in the **Contacts**
application).

If the customer was referred by another customer or contact, enter their name in the
:guilabel:`Referrer` field.

If a :guilabel:`Referrer` is selected, a new field, :guilabel:`Commission Plan` appears, in which a
commission can be selected from the drop-down menu. This commission is rewarded to the contact
selected in the :guilabel:`Referrer` field.

Next, if they have not already been auto-populated with the customer's information, enter the
appropriate addresses in the :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and :guilabel:`Delivery Address` fields.
Both of these fields are **required**.

Then, if desired, choose a :guilabel:`Quotation Template` from the drop-down field to apply to this
quotation. It should be noted that some additional fields may appear, depending on the template
selected. The :guilabel:`Default Template` option is selected, by default.

The default date that appears in the :guilabel:`Expiration` field is based on the number configured
in the *Quotation expires after* field on the quotation template form.

.. tip::
   To access the various quotation forms, go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration -->
   Quotation Templates`. Alternatively, hover over the :guilabel:`Quotation Template` field on the
   quotation form, and click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon to view that
   specific quotation template form.

If the quotation is for a recurring product or subscription, select the desired
:guilabel:`Recurrence` option from that specific drop-down menu.

If a :guilabel:`Recurrence` option is selected, an :guilabel:`until` field appears beside it. In
this field, select the desired date the :guilabel:`Recurrence` should end, via a calendar popover
window.

Also, if a :guilabel:`Recurrence` option is selected, a new form, :guilabel:`Freeze Plan` appears on
the quotation form, between :guilabel:`Referrer` and :guilabel:`Commission Plan`. When this checkbox
is ticked, the commission plan does not automatically update.

Next, select a specific :guilabel:`Pricelist` to be applied to this quotation, if desired.

Lastly, select any specific :guilabel:`Payment Terms` to be used for this quotation.

Order Lines tab
---------------

The first tab on the quotation form is the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab.

In this tab, select products, and quantities of those products, to add to the quotation.

Click :guilabel:`Add a product`, select the desired item from the :guilabel:`Product` drop-down
field, and proceed to adjust the quantity of that selected product, if necessary.

If multiple items should be presented in a more organized way on the quotation, click :guilabel:`Add
a section`, enter a name for the section, and drag-and-drop that section heading in the desired
location amongst the items in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab. The section heading appears in bold.

If needed, click :guilabel:`Add a note` beneath a certain product line to add a custom note about
that specific product. The note appears in italics. Then, if needed, proceed to drag-and-drop the
note beneath the desired product line.

Beneath the product lines, there are buttons that can be clicked to apply any of the following:
:guilabel:`Add Shipping`, :guilabel:`Coupon Code`, and :guilabel:`Promotions`.

Optional Products tab
---------------------

Open the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab to select related products that can be presented to the
customer, which may result in an increased sale.

For example, if the customer wants to buy a car, an optional product that could be offered is a
*Trailer Hitch*.

Sending and confirming quotations
=================================

Once all the necessary fields and tabs have been configured, it is time to send the quotation to the
customer for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the quotation turns into an official sales order.

At the top of the form, there is a series of buttons:

- :guilabel:`Send by Email`: When clicked, a pop-up window appears with the customer's name and
  email address in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, the quotation (and reference ID) in the
  :guilabel:`Subject` field, and a brief default message in the body of the email, which can be
  modified, if needed.

  Below that, a PDF copy of the quotation is attached. When ready, click :guilabel:`Send` to send
  the quotation, via email, to the customer, so they can review and confirm it.
- :guilabel:`Send PRO-FORMA Invoice`: This button **only** appears if the *Pro-Forma Invoice*
  setting has been enabled. When clicked, a pop-up window appears with the customer's name and email
  address in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, the *Proforma* invoice (and reference ID) in the
  :guilabel:`Subject` field, and a brief default message in the body of the email, which can be
  modified, if needed.

  Below that, a PDF copy of the quotation is attached. When ready, click :guilabel:`Send` to send
  the quotation, via email, to the customer, so they can review and confirm it.
- :guilabel:`Confirm`: When clicked, the quotation is confirmed, and the status changes to
  :guilabel:`Sales Order`.
- :guilabel:`Cancel`: When clicked, the quotation is canceled.

There is also a :guilabel:`Customer Preview` smart button present, in the upper-right corner of the
form. When clicked, Odoo reveals a preview of the quotation the customer sees when they log into
their customer portal. Click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Back to edit mode` link at the
top of the preview page, in the blue banner, to return to the quotation form.

.. note::
   If the *Lock Confirmed Sales* setting is enabled, the sales order becomes :guilabel:`Locked`, and
   is indicated as such on the sales order form.

At this point, the quotation has been confirmed, turned into a sales order, and is now ready to be
invoiced and paid for.
